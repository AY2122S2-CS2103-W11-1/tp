### Project: NUSocials

NUSocials is a desktop address book application for university students who like to maintain a professional contact list. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature Enhancement**: Added the ability to delete multiple contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete multiple contacts in a single command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as a user can efficiently delete many contacts at once instead of inputting a delete command for each contact that he or she wants to delete.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing UI layout. It required an in-depth analysis of how the contacts would be displayed during the deletion process.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove tags from existing contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove tags from an existing contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to simply remove a tag, otherwise users have to recreate another contact.

* Updated the UI to fit requirements for new features
  * Added a split-pane to fit 2 panels (contacts panel and events panel)
  * Designed the events panel

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ongkimlai&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&zA=ongkimlai&zR=AY2122S2-CS2103T-W11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=81.23391812865498&zS=2022-02-18&zFS=&zU=2022-02-26&zMG=false&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos&zFR=false)
