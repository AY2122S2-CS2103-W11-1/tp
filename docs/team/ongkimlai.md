### Project: NUSocials

NUSocials is a desktop address book application for university students who like to maintain a professional contact list. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to tag existing contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to tag additional information to an existing contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can tag important information to their own contacts for future references.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing UI layout. It required an in-depth analysis of how the tagged information should be displayed alongside with their respective contacts.

* **Feature Enhancement**: Added the ability to delete multiple contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete multiple contacts in a single command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as a user can efficiently delete many contacts at once instead of inputting a delete command for each contact that he or she wants to delete.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove tags from existing contacts.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove tags from an existing contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user does not have to key in every tag again with the `edit` command just to remove a few tags.

* Updated the UI to fit requirements for new features (events)
