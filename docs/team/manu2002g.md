### Project: NUSocials

NUSocials is a desktop address book application for university students who like to maintain a professional contact list. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature (to be added soon)**: Added the ability to view all contact entries.
  * What it does: allows the user to view a list of all contacts in the stored in the database
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view all their contacts and choose which ones to tag or delete.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required an analysis of the UI design layout to find the best possible way to display the result.

* **New Feature (to be added soon)**: Added the ability to edit previously added entries
  * What it does: allows the user to change the details or tags of a previously added contact
  * Justification:  Users may make mistakes when entering contact details or tags. We should allow them to rectify this using an edit command
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
