## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Kim Lai`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Kim Lai t/friend` or as `n/Kim Lai`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MODULES]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/CS2040S`, `m/CS2030S m/CS2100` etc.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12345678 p/87654321`, onbly `p/87654321` will be taken.
*
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All commands are case-sensitive.
